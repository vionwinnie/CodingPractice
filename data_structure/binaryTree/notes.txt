Binary Tree

Operations: [h = length of tree]
- Search = O(h) 
- Insertion = O(h) [search, insert]
- Delete = O(h)

Insertion / Deletion 
- Structure cannot guarntee the h for sure -> there are complicated algorithm to maintain balance of the tree 

Find Min and Max
- left most node = Min
- right most node = Max

Traversal:

In-order Traversal:
a.traverse_left
b.process_item
c.traverse_right

Pre-order Traversal:
a. process_item
b. traverse_left
c. traverse_right

Post-order Traversal:
a. traverse_left
b. traverse_right
c. process_item

Usage:
- In order: non decreasing order
- Pre order: create copy, get prefix
- Post order:delete tree,  get postfix expression
