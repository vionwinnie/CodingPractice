Stacks, Queues, and Lists
- SOLVED: Check nested parentheses
- SOLVED:Implement linear time reversal of direction of a single-linked list
	- A -> B -> C
	- C -> B -> A

	NOTE: there is an iteratively way and a recursive way
Tree:
- Concantenate two binary search trees into one / running time = O(h) h = max(height)
