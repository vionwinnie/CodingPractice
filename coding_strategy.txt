## Listing solving coding strategy by each data structure

Linked List:
- Usually iterative would suffice
- Common strategy is
	- Fast and slow pointers
	- Keep prev/curr/next pointers
- If double-linked list is tested in interviews, it will be explicitly stated

- Fast and slow pointers:
	- If fast is K nodes > slow:
		- Move at same speed
	- Fast moving at twice the speed
		- Detecting loop
